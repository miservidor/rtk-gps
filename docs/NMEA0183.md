# NMEA 0183 Protocol Documentation

## Introduction
NMEA 0183 is a standard for communication between marine electronics, primarily used for navigation and other maritime applications. The protocol defines a set of standardized sentences that devices such as GPS receivers, depth sounders, autopilots, and other navigational equipment use to communicate.

## Structure of NMEA 0183 Sentences
NMEA 0183 messages, also called "sentences," follow a structured format:

```
$<talker ID><sentence type>,<data fields>*<checksum><CR><LF>
```

### Components:

![image](./images/LC29H(XX)_GPS-other.jpg)

- `$` : Start of a sentence.
- `<talker ID>` : Two-character identifier for the transmitting device.
- `<sentence type>` : Three-character code defining the message type.
- `<data fields>` : Comma-separated values containing the message-specific data.
- `*<checksum>` : A two-character hexadecimal checksum for error detection.
- `<CR><LF>` : Carriage return and line feed indicating the end of the sentence.

## Talker Identifiers
Each NMEA 0183 sentence begins with a two-character talker identifier that denotes the device transmitting the data.

| Talker ID | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| GP | GPS Receiver |
| GL | GLONASS Receiver |
| GN | Combined GPS/GLONASS Receiver |
| EC | Electronic Chart Display |
| SD | Depth Sounder |
| VD | Velocity Sensor |

## Common NMEA 0183 Sentences
Here are some common NMEA 0183 sentences used in navigation systems:

### 1. **GGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data**
Provides time, position, and fix-related data.
```
$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47
```
- `123519` - Fix time in UTC (hhmmss)
- `4807.038,N` - Latitude (ddmm.mmm,N/S)
- `01131.000,E` - Longitude (dddmm.mmm,E/W)
- `1` - Fix quality (0 = no fix, 1 = GPS fix, 2 = DGPS fix)
- `08` - Number of satellites in use
- `0.9` - Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP)
- `545.4,M` - Altitude above mean sea level (meters)

### 2. **RMC - Recommended Minimum Specific GNSS Data**
Provides essential GPS data including position, speed, and time.
```
$GPRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A
```
- `A` - Status (A = Valid, V = Invalid)
- `022.4` - Speed over ground (knots)
- `084.4` - Course over ground (degrees)
- `230394` - Date (ddmmyy)

### 3. **GSV - Satellites in View**
Reports the number of satellites in view, including PRN, elevation, azimuth, and SNR.
```
$GPGSV,3,1,12,02,45,123,41,04,22,178,33,05,67,001,50,*7F
```
- `3` - Total number of messages
- `1` - Message number
- `12` - Total number of satellites in view
- `02,45,123,41` - PRN, elevation, azimuth, SNR (dB)

### 4. **VTG - Course Over Ground and Speed**
Indicates actual track and ground speed.
```
$GPVTG,054.7,T,034.4,M,005.5,N,010.2,K*48
```
- `054.7,T` - Course over ground (degrees true)
- `034.4,M` - Course over ground (degrees magnetic)
- `005.5,N` - Speed (knots)
- `010.2,K` - Speed (km/h)

## Checksum Calculation
The checksum is calculated as the XOR of all characters between `$` and `*`.

Example:
```
$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47
```
- XOR all ASCII values of `GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,`
- Result: `47`

## Example

Recommended Minimum Specific GPS/TRANSIT Data（RMC）Recommended Positioning Information
$GPRMC,<1>,<2>,<3>,<4>,<5>,<6>,<7>,<8>,<9>,<10>,<11>,<12>*hh<CR><LF>
$GNRMC,010555.000,A,2232.4682,N,11404.6748,E,0.00,125.29,230822,,,D*71
<1> UTC time, hhmmss.sss (hours, minutes, seconds) format 
<2> Position status, A=effective positioning, V=invalid positioning
<3> Longitude ddmm.mmmm (degree cents) format (leading zeros will also be transmitted) 
<4> Latitude hemispheres N (Northern Hemisphere) or S (Southern Hemisphere) 
<5> Longitudes dddmm.mmmm (degree cents) format (leading zeros will also be transmitted) 
<6> Longitude hemisphere E (East) or W (West) 
<7> Ground rate (Sections 000.0 to 999.9, preceding zeros will also be transmitted) 
<8> Ground heading (000.0 to 359.9 degrees, with true north as the reference datum, and leading zeros will also be transmitted) 
<9> UTC date, ddmmyy (day month year) format 
<10> Magnetic declination angle (000.0 to 180.0 degrees, leading zeros will also be transmitted) 
<11> Direction of magnetic declination, E (East) or W (West) 
<12> Mode indication (NMEA0183 version 3.00 output only, A=autonomous localization, D=differential, E=estimation, N=data invalid)
*hh: The final check digit *hh is the data used to do the checksum. It is not required for normal use but is recommended when there is strong electromagnetic interference in the surrounding environment. hh represents the bitwise exclusive OR value of all characters of "$" and "*" (excluding these two characters). Individual manufacturers are to define their own statement format to "$P" at the beginning, followed by 3 characters of the manufacturer's ID identification number, followed by a customized data body.


## Conclusion
NMEA 0183 is a widely used protocol in the maritime industry, facilitating interoperability between navigation devices. Understanding the structure and key sentences helps in decoding and utilizing the information effectively for GPS and other marine applications.
